Hidden gem amazing for Roundhouse 
",The pictures looked good but in reality the quality of the room was so much better than expected. It is literally across the road from the Roundhouse plus it’s above a great Camden pub. The staff were very welcoming (Aidan in particular) and I would definitely stay here again. ,Only slight drawback is our room must’ve been above one of the loos because we heard the fans dryer going off occasionally. But it’s over a pub! So a) You have to expect this sort of thing and b) it only went on til closing time and considering we were out til late it really didn’t matter.

Birthday Trip 🍾
","WOW...
This hotel is honestly one of the best I’ve ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived, to the minute we checked out, everything was incredible 🤩
I’d booked it pretty last minute, for my boyfriend and I to celebrate his birthday. I emailed the hotel in advance to let them know it was a special occasion. Upon arriving at the hotel, one of the lovely ladies at reception (I didn’t catch her name) was so welcoming and told us everything we needed to know.
After checking in, we went up to our room on the 17th floor (1706). WOW x2! The room was spotlessly clean, and was honestly better than I could have ever hoped. The highlight was probably the amazing view of the city skyline. Seeing London at sunset, lit up at night and waking up to it in the morning was incredible.
Upon exploring the room, we came across a birthday card and caramel chocolate left for my boyfriend - such a nice touch. It sounds a bit odd, but we also couldn’t get over how nice the bathroom was! I mean the glass wall in the shower frosts with the touch of a button... we even took a video 😂
After checking in, we went down to use the pool. Again, everything was perfect. The changing rooms were so nice and clean and the pool was beautiful! Great temperature and the perfect way to unwind after travelling into Canary Wharf from Essex.
After using the pool, we came back up to our room to order a snack and a few drinks via room service. Great service again - the fries, along with a couple of beers, with our view of London went down a treat!
We didn’t visit the hotel restaurant (Bokan) for dinner, but we did go up to the bar later on that night. The service was impeccable once again, and the rooftop bar has the best 360 degree views of london 🥂
Honestly, don’t even hesitate to book this hotel!",Everything was perfect!

They gave us (beautiful) wine glasses to take up to our room to drink a night cap (as the bar closed at 9:30).",We were very disappointed not to have been able to have a drink in the bar. It would have been good if we had been advised to book well in advance as it meant we didn't get to experience any of the beautifully designed communal hotel spaces. Another gripe is that the hotel door on to the Southbank river side was locked when we tried to go out for a walk on Sunday morning. Apparently it only opens at 12 noon. Maybe that's Covid related too as they need to man the doors to take temperature.

The hotel is fantastically located and the suite was amazing! The view over the river thames was spectacular, particularly in the evening. It was lovely to have the wall-to-wall glass doors and the balcony. Massive bathroom and great shower. Room service was prompt and food was great (quite expensive - but normal for central london). I told the hotel in advance about my partners birthday and they left a bottle of prosecco in the room which was a lovely touch which we really appreciated. Thank you to the staff for working so hard to keep customers happy during the pandemic. Would happily stay again. Dr Butler",

","Great location and an amazing riverside view of the river Thames.  Glass of bubbly on arrival..nice touch. Very Covid friendly with temp checks on arrival into the hotel and hand sanitiser everywhere. 
Not everything was in the room due to covid, but that was no problem..but annoyingly had to pay for a tray charge for when ordering from the mini bar service  (which wasn’t filled due to covid) so I thought was a bit wrong we had to pay for some soft drinks which would have been in the room any other time!

And on top of all that at the last day I just went to travel and forgot to check out. I was no more no less than 5 hours late. On my way  to the reception desk to tell them I was prepared already to be charged for an extra day. I only managed to explain in one sentence what happened and immediately the so nice and friendly Danila and Nikita who were on shift at that time said ""Sir we are not going to charge you any extra money"".

I'm not going to use paper that anyone else has used before me. This hotel costs 9600 rubles a day, that is about $150 and it is not in the center of Moscow. This is a terrible hotel. Then it turned out that the safe in the room is not working, and the refrigerator is simply not available. The fridge had been brought in after the bell rang, but the safe had never been repaired. There is no shelf in the room. As it turned out later, the shower cabin flows and floods the entire bathroom and a towel does not save from this. The temperature in the room was terrible, then hot, then cold. There's no climate control.

2) Rooms were clean and tidy and comfortable and well thought with modern design.
3) Location was superb! You have tube station Sentier (line #3), just opposite the street. There's a really cute street with an authentic French atmosphere and lots of cafes, brasseries down the street.
4) Swanne, the host, was extremely polite, very attentive to your needs, and genuinely open and caring. She arranged perfect breakfast, there was no need for us to go to the brassiere. She gave very good advices for our trip to the south of France. After all we felt like we stayed in our friend's house. Merci beaucoup for that!","1) TINAH means ""this is not a hotel"". We didn't pay much attention to the description of the hotel. We arrived there late at the evening, around 10.30pm, and found out there in front of the door that there's no reception and we need the password to enter to the building. If you're an international tourist and you don't have internet connection and roaming on your mobile it could be a problem to enter inside the building. You'll need to call to the hotel number to get the password. It wood had been easier to get the password to the authorized email beforehand. At the end we called and got the password and had no problem, but it's better to keep this in mind.
2) We wood kindly recommend to the owner to put additional details into the rooms to make it more handy for living. We mean such a small things as towel hungers, soap holder, tooth brush cup, some mini shelf in the shower to put your own shower stuff."

Breakfast was more than adequate, even though there were no croissants or pains au chocolat as the bakery downstairs had closed for holidays. A very Parisian phenomenon, which only happens in August. 
Another thing to remember when planning your stay, is that Tinah is not a hotel and does not have a receptionist who can take care of your luggage before check-in or after check-out. "

Flawed Concept but Good location
","Very well furnished, clean and tidy.
The location is brilliant, close to most major attractions and metro access is almost outside the door.","No reception or permanent staff on-site. Perhaps millennials would be happy with only messaging the proprietors, I am afraid I am not although they responded quickly when I did contact them prior to staying. The rooms are essentially on the top floor of an office block, you are given a code (which worked well) but this is a step-away from a traditional hotel service and hence, a downgraded experience. Very noisy, there was a buzzer which kept going off at 2-5 minute intervals ALl NIGHT! and noise from the street. Poor breakfast, some granola, no milk, french toast and on Sunday, no croissant etc. quite limited, warm juice out of a bottle. Breakfast is served immediately outside the rooms and hence there is disturbance from 7.20am onwards so little chance of an undisturbed sleep past that time. The shower was weak and either scalding (really scalding) or cold, best we managed was luke-warm."

Gorgeous hotel with beautiful decor, great location and well worth the money!
","The location is perfect, there are various stations and bus stops nearby.  The hotel is exactly like the images and the rooms are lovely.","The welcome staff were not always in the communal area and we had an issue with toiletries not being replaced after room service, we got back in the evening and did not know who to contact, it would have been nice if there was a way of contacting someone in the evening."

We had a wonderful stay. The accommodation was great & the bathroom bigger than expected. Thanks!
","The room itself and bathroom was incredibly spacious (by European standards) and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable. Myself and my husband had plenty of space to manoeuvre. The view from our room was lovely, overlooking Rue Reamur. Great coffee and really friendly staff.",There wasn't enough hanging space for bags and coats (there could have been a few wall hooks). There were no shelves in the shower to put your toiletries on.  The aircon wasn't working properly and we were very hot in our room at night. It was fixed on our last day there. The breakfast is also a bit sparse but it was as expected.

Loved it. It's a fabulous place to stay and good value for money.
","The location is excellent with great access to the Metro and Shops. 
It's walking distance to the Louvre and Pompidou Centre.
The Continental Breakfast was very good.
The Staff are very friendly and keen to ensure that you have an excellent stay.","Due to the location of Tinah on the 6th floor of an Apartment block; you have to pay close attention to the instructions on how to gain entry. These are actually very clear and are emailed prior to arrival, so I think they have done a lot to mitigate this already, but if you want to visit - ensure you read this mail carefully."

","Fabulous place. It’s not a hotel, much more of a B&B. Excellent location and great instructions of how to get in and where to go. Owner was really lovely and welcoming the next day when I met her - nothing was too much, and it was a perfect ‘home from home’. If you want to stay and live like a Parisian but have some amenities of a hotel - this is the place for you. Cannot wait to return and stay again - next time in my new favourite room. Thank you so much again - everything was just wonderful.","Would have been great to have a little Welcome Pack with information on the rooms, timings for breakfast etc. But this is such a small thing and everything was so easy to find!
